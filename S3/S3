S3
    Object Storage
    Easy to use, pay only what you use

    Usage
        Backup/ archive
        Content distribution
        Big data analysis
        Static website hosting
        Cloud native application hosting (???)
        Disaster recovery
    Offers Storage classes
        General purpose
        Infrequent access
        Archive
    Object vs File Storage
        Server independent , accessed using HTTP verbs
        No file / folder hierarchy
        No partial data access
        No worry about
            Storage space , capacity planning
        Highly durable / scalable
            Auto replicated (durable)
            Buckets are auto partitioned if traffic is High
S3 Basics
    Buckets
        Container
        Name must be unique globally
        63 chars
        100 buckets / account
    Regions
        Bucket created in region
        Control your data's location 
            Close to users
            Far from primary (disster recovery)
    Objects
        Can store any data; size uto 5tb
        Object has data + medata
            AWS doesnt care abt data (opaque)
            medata
                system
                    Modified timestamp, Hash
                user
                    tags. only at create time
                custom medata 
                    added after created
    Keys
        Upto 1024 bytes UTF-8
    Object URL
        <bucketname>.s3.amazonaws.com/keyname

    Durability and Availability
        Durability - will i be able to access data in future. 11 9's
        Availability - can i access my data now 99.99%
    Consistency
        Data is replicated in aws, so eventually consistant
        for new object put. read-after-write Consistency provided
        all operations to SINGLE key are atomic. So you will never get partially updated data

    Access Control
        IAM policy, Bucket Policy, ACLs
        ACLs 
            Legacy, used before IAM. >20kb
            on the object level access.
        Bucket
            Bucket level upto 20kb
            like IAM but it has EXPLICIT reference to principle 
    Static website hosting
S3 advance features
    Delimiters
        just for organize, manage
        IAM , bucket policy understands this
            Restrict or share data of subdirectories
        AWS console, CLI understands this
    Storage classes
        Standard
            general purpose
            long/short term of FREQUENTLY accessed data
        Infrequent access (lower availability)
            Data which is Infrequently accessed
            Minimum 30days duration , 128kb min size
            lower const
            Same durability, latency, high throughput (so somewhat lower availability)
        RRS (lower durability)
            Data that can be derived
            Lower durability
        Glacier  (least availability , higher availability)
            no real time access
            response time ? 5 hours acceptable
            once restore command issued; data is moved to RRS 
            Free if 5% accessed
