Compute Basics
    Launching of instance
    Use computer , charge is hourly basis
    software part - AMI , hardware part - instance type
Intance types
AMI
    Aws published
    Marketplace
        Additional charges
    Saved from ec2 instance
    VM/Imported Uploaded
         Usage
         Migrate Your Existing Applications and Workloads to Amazon EC2
         Create a Disaster Recovery Repository for your VM images
         Copy Your VM Image Catalog to Amazon EC2
Security of instances
    Addressing of instances
        public DNS name
        public Ip 
            persists only till ec2 runs
        elastic Ip
            persists even when ec2 is terminated
    Initial access
        Public key cryptography
        Windows - admin password encrypted using symmetric key encryption
    Virtual firewall
        Security groups
            accept / deny rules, stateful
Lifecycle of instances
    Launching
        bootstarpping 
            - install custom software while instance is being launched
            UserData - script to be executed. un-encrypted - no passwords should be mentioned
            Uses - install custom s/w , enroll into directory services, OS level patch, chef / puppet
        vm/import export
            - can import existing vm images to ec2 (and then back)
            - instances launch within AWS from AMI's cant exported
        instance metadata
            - http://publicip/latest/meta-data
            - instance type , id, security group, ami 
    Managing
        Tagging
        Monitoring
    Modifying instance
        Instance type can be changed by stopping, specifying new type and relaunching it 
        Changing security group to allow more protocols 
    Termination protection
        call for termination will be failed till it disables
        still can terminate using - os shutdown command, autoscale, overbidden
Options
    Pricing
        On-Demand instance
            price/ hour, no up-front commitment
            provision computer for unpredictable load
        Reserved 
            upfront commit for predictable and steady load 
            saves 75% of price than on-Demand
            cost depends on two factors
                Term commitment
                    One or three years
                payment Options
                    all upfront
                    partial
                    no upfront
        Spot
            Workload is not time critical and interruption tollerent
            Specify price for instance, 
            so instance runs till
                customer terminates orsomeone bids higher
    Tenancy
        Shared
            One host machine can serve EC2 of more than one customer
        Dedicated instance
            One host machine serves EC2 instances of only one customers
        Dedicated host
            One machine serves as only ONE EC2 insatce
            reqiured for licensing 
    Placement groups
        logical grouping of EC2 instance within single avaiability zones
        applications benefitted from low network latency
        EC2 which supports enahnced networking should be chosen
    Instance stores
        Temporary storage attached to host machine
        no persistancy
        idle for temp storage backup , cahche, db io buffer
        use on EC2 where data processing is more important than data storage
        Multiple types
            1. Ephimeral
            2. Non Volatile Memory -i3 instance
            3. TRIM
